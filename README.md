After installation, you should have a new program shortcut on your desktop or Start menu.

### 3. Launch PrintVault3D

Open the app by double-clicking its icon. The program window will appear, showing a blank library.

### 4. Add Your 3D Models

- Click the **Add Folder** button or use the menu option to select folders where your 3D files are stored.  
- The app will scan these folders and list your models with thumbnails and detail.  
- You can add multiple folders if you keep models in different places.  

### 5. Explore Model Details

Select any model to see information such as:

- File name and size  
- Model dimensions  
- Estimated print time (from G-code files)  
- Slice settings and filament usage (if available)  

This helps you decide what to print next without opening complex software.

### 6. Synchronize Your Library

If you work with multiple computers or folders, use the synchronization feature to keep your library up to date. Set the source and target folders, and the app will copy new or updated files automatically.

## 🔧 How to Use Key Features

### Organizing Files

- Use drag and drop to move models within your library.  
- Right-click on files to rename, delete, or open them in another program.  

### Viewing Thumbnails

- Thumbnails generate automatically when you add a folder.  
- If you update files outside the app, use the **Refresh** option to update previews.  

### Analyzing G-code

- When you select a G-code file, PrintVault3D reads the code and shows print time, layer height, infill percentage, and more.  
- This helps you prepare before sending the job to your 3D printer.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting & Tips

- **If thumbnails don’t appear:** Make sure your files are not corrupted and supported by the app. Refresh your library view.  
- **If the app won’t open:** Confirm your computer meets the system requirements, and .NET Framework is installed.  
- **For slow performance:** Close other programs to free memory, or reduce the number of folders scanned at once.  
- **Library sync conflicts:** Avoid editing files manually in both synced folders simultaneously.
